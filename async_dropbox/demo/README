This is a very simple app that demonstrates basic usage of the dropbox API.

To run the app, you'll need to register with Dropbox to get an API key:
https://www.dropbox.com/developers/apps

Copy the file config.flags.sample to config.flags and fill in the blanks
with the "App key" and "App secret" values from your registered application.
