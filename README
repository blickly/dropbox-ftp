Hack project that runs a simple FTP server supporting GET, PUT, and LS that backs up
the files to dropbox.

Large parts shamelessly stolen from pyftplib and bdarnell's async_dropbox API.

To use, first:
0) Install the Dropbox API SDK and tornado
1) Copy config_flags.py.example to config_flags.py and fill in your API keys
2) Run:
  python run_servers.py
3) Connect to your server at port 8888, to get your ftp username and password
4) FTP to your server at port 2121, using the id from step 3
5) Enjoy!
